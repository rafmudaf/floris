    """The Curl model class computes the wake velocity deficit based on the curled
    wake model developed in
    :cite:`cvm-martinez2019aerodynamics`. The curled wake
    model includes the change in the shape of the wake profile under yawed
    conditions due to vortices that are shed from the rotor plane of a yawed
    turbine. For more information about the curled wake model theory, see
    :cite:`cvm-martinez2019aerodynamics`. For more
    information about the impact of the curled wake behavior on wake steering,
    see :cite:`cvm-fleming2018simulation`.

    Args:
        model_grid_resolution(:py:obj:`Union[List[float], Vec3]`): A list of three
            floats, or `Vec3` object that define the flow field grid resolution in the
            x, y, and z directions used for the curl wake model calculations. The grid
            resolution is specified as the number of grid points in the flow field
            domain in the x, y, and z directions, by default [250, 100, 75].
        initial_deficit (:py:obj:`float`): Parameter that, along with the freestream
            velocity and the turbine's induction factor, is used to determine the
            initial wake velocity deficit immediately downstream of the rotor, by
            default 2.0.
        dissipation (:py:obj:`float`): A scaling parameter that determines the amount of
            dissipation of the vortices with downstream distance, by default 0.06.
        veer_linear (:py:obj:`float`): Describes the amount of linear wind veer. This
            parameter defines the linear change in the V velocity between the ground and
            hub height; therefore, determines the slope of the change in the V velocity
            with height, by default 0.0.
        ti_initial (:py:obj:`float`): Initial ambient turbulence intensity, expressed as
            a decimal fraction, by default 0.1.
        ti_constant (:py:obj:`float`): The constant used to scale the wake-added
            turbulence intensity, by default 0.73.
        ti_ai (:py:obj:`float`): The axial induction factor exponent used in in the
            calculation of wake-added turbulence, by default 0.8.
        ti_downstream (:py:obj:`float`): The exponent applied to the distance downstream
            of an upstream turbine normalized by the rotor diameter used in the
            calculation of wake-added turbulence, by default 0.275.
